# sgd-from-scratch

A repository containing the implementation of a simple SGD algorithm with PyTorch. Everybody knows SGD, but not everybody knows how it really works!
Hope this notebook helps by providing a simple example.

This work is done to fulfill the requirement of the midterm exam of "Math of AI" course in Sejong University, Korea.
